# Writing your poker bot

Your bot plays No-Limit Texas Hold'em against other bots. **You only need to edit one file: `my_bot.py`.**

## 1. Get set up

You need Python 3.10 or newer. Check with `python3 --version`. There's nothing to install.

```
bots/
├── my_bot.py      ← your bot. Edit this!
├── pokerbot/      ← helper code. You don't need to touch it.
└── README.md      ← you are here
```

## 2. Run the example bot

The organiser will tell you the server's **host** and **port**:

```bash
python3 my_bot.py --host 192.168.1.20 --port 8000
```

You'll see your bot connect, wait for the match, then play each hand:

```
[MyBot] Connected as p3. Waiting for a match to start...
[MyBot] Match started! I'm in seat 2 with 6 players.
[MyBot] Hand 1: I have As Kd
[MyBot]   preflop board [] pot 30 -> call
```

### Testing on your own computer

If you're running the server yourself, play your bot against copies of itself:

```bash
python3 my_bot.py --port 8000 --count 4 --quiet
```

`--count 4` starts 4 copies, and `--quiet` means only the first one prints.

## 3. Make it yours

Open `my_bot.py`. First, change `BOT_NAME` to your team name. Then edit `decide()`. It runs every time it's your turn and must **return one move**:

| Return this | What it does |
|---|---|
| `fold()` | Give up this hand. |
| `check()` | Pass without betting. Only works when nobody has bet. |
| `call()` | Match the current bet. |
| `raise_to(100)` | Make your **total** bet this round 100 chips. Also how you make the first bet. |
| `all_in()` | Bet everything you have. |

**Don't panic about mistakes.** If you return a move that isn't allowed, forget to return, or your code crashes, the bot fixes it with a safe move and prints a note telling you what happened. Your bot keeps playing.

### What your bot can see

Everything is on `state`:

| | |
|---|---|
| `state.my_cards` | Your two cards, e.g. `["As", "Kd"]` |
| `state.board` | The shared cards: none before the flop, then 3, 4 and 5 |
| `state.street` | `"preflop"`, `"flop"`, `"turn"` or `"river"` |
| `state.pot` | Chips in the middle |
| `state.to_call` | Chips you need to put in to call (0 means you can check) |
| `state.can_check` / `state.can_raise` | What's allowed right now |
| `state.min_raise` / `state.max_raise` | The smallest and largest amounts you can `raise_to()` |
| `state.my_stack` | Chips you have left |
| `state.pot_odds` | Cost of calling as a share of the pot after you call. Lower means calling is cheaper. |
| `state.opponents` | The other players. Each has `.name`, `.stack`, `.bet`, `.status`, `.in_hand` |
| `state.opponents_in_hand` | Just the opponents who haven't folded |
| `state.history` | Every move so far this hand. Each has `.name`, `.action`, `.amount`, `.street` |
| `state.hand_number` / `state.hands_in_match` | e.g. hand 7 of 20 |

### Cards

A card is a 2-letter string: **rank** then **suit**.

- Ranks: `2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 T J Q K A` (`T` is ten)
- Suits: `c` clubs, `d` diamonds, `h` hearts, `s` spades

So `"As"` is the Ace of spades and `"Td"` is the Ten of diamonds.

Helpers in `pokerbot.cards`:

```python
from pokerbot.cards import rank, suit, card_name, is_pair, is_suited, describe_hand, hand_strength

rank("As")                         # 14   (2-10, J=11, Q=12, K=13, A=14)
suit("As")                         # "s"
card_name("Td")                    # "Ten of Diamonds"
is_pair(["Kh", "Kd"])              # True
is_suited(["Ah", "7h"])            # True
describe_hand(state.my_cards, state.board)   # e.g. "Two pair"
hand_strength(state.my_cards, state.board)   # 0.0 (bad) to 1.0 (amazing)
```

## 4. The rules

- Up to 6 bots at a table. Everyone starts with **1000 chips**. Blinds are **10/20**.
- A match is **20 hands**. Whoever has the most chips at the end wins.
- You have **5 seconds** per move. If you're too slow, you check, or fold if you can't check.
- If your bot disconnects, it can't rejoin that match. Its seat keeps checking and folding until the end.

## 5. Ideas to make your bot better

The example bot is simple on purpose. Some things to try:

1. **Play fewer hands.** Folding weak starting cards like 7-2 saves chips.
2. **Bet more with great hands.** Try betting a fraction of `state.pot` instead of always 3× the minimum.
3. **Use position.** Acting last is an advantage. Compare `state.my_seat` with `state.button`.
4. **Count opponents.** A pair is worth more against 1 opponent than against 5. Use `len(state.opponents_in_hand)`.
5. **Watch your opponents.** `state.history` shows who has been raising. Some bots bluff a lot!
6. **Improve `hand_strength`.** It's in `pokerbot/cards.py`, and it doesn't know when the board helps everyone. Copy it into `my_bot.py` and make it smarter.
7. **Bluff sometimes.** `import random` and raise with a weak hand now and then.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| `Couldn't connect to ...` | Check the server is running and the host and port are right. On a different computer, use the organiser's IP, not `127.0.0.1`. |
| `Your decide() crashed!` | Read the error underneath. It points to the line in `my_bot.py` that broke. |
| `Note: ...` | Your move wasn't allowed, so the bot made a safe move instead. The note says why. |
| Nothing happens after "Waiting for a match" | The organiser hasn't started the match yet. |
