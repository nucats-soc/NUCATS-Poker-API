This is the only file you need to edit. Change decide() to change how your
bot plays.

Run it (the organiser will tell you the host and port):
    python my_bot.py --host 192.168.1.20 --port 8000

Test it on your own computer against 3 copies of itself:
    python my_bot.py --port 8000 --count 4 --quiet

    Called every time it's your turn. Look at `state`, then return ONE of:

        fold()          give up this hand
        check()         pass without betting (only if state.can_check)
        call()          match the current bet (costs state.to_call chips)
        raise_to(100)   make your total bet this round 100 chips
        all_in()        bet everything

    Handy things in `state`:
        state.my_cards     your two cards, e.g. ["As", "Kd"]
        state.board        the shared cards on the table
        state.street       "preflop", "flop", "turn" or "river"
        state.pot          chips in the middle
        state.to_call      chips you need to call (0 means you can check)
        state.can_check    True if checking is allowed
        state.can_raise    True if raising is allowed
        state.min_raise    smallest amount you can raise_to()
        state.max_raise    largest amount you can raise_to() (all-in)
        state.my_stack     chips you have left
        state.opponents    the other players (name, stack, bet, status)
        state.history      everything that has happened this hand
        state.pot_odds     how much calling costs compared to the pot

    And from pokerbot.cards:
        hand_strength(my_cards, board)   a score from 0 (bad) to 1 (amazing)
        describe_hand(my_cards, board)   e.g. "Two pair"
        rank("As") -> 14,  is_pair(["Kh", "Kd"]) -> True

    Don't worry about making an illegal move: it gets fixed for you, and a
    note is printed so you can see what happened.
